REPLACING STOCK SWARMOPS LOGO WITH CUSTOM LOGO

In this folder, you will see a file named "Logo-Stock.png". That is the
logo displayed at the top left of every Swarmops page. Changing this
file directly has no persistent effect, as it will be replaced on every
minor update (every two weeks).

If you wish another image to be displayed, place a file named
"Logo-Custom.png" in this folder, and it will be used instead.

You can make it taller than the Logo-Stock image, in case you want
a specific element of your logo to partially cover the menu for
graphic effect. The logo image is above the menu background, but
below the menu text.
